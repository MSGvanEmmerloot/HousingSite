# HousingSite

## Synopsis

Using this project, it is possible to search for rental houses on multiple sites, which will then be shown with the bing maps API. A starting point has to be chosen, it is possible to only show houses within a certain radius around this point, or within a certain travel duration.

## Usage

In order to use the bing maps API, you need to sign up to the [Bing Maps Dev Center](https://www.bingmapsportal.com/ "Bing Maps Dev Center") and generate a key. In HousingSite/Data/Credentials.cs, {BINGMAPS_KEY} has to be replaced with this key.
